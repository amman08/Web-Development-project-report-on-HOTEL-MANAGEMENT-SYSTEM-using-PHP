Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

The web pages were designed using HTML script and CSS language was used to enhance the user experience. Various forms were designed to take details about students and faculty from the administrator. Once the details were received from the user, PHP script was used to send and store that data in a database.
